# Project Overview
With this project we are further developing  a web page dedicated to turning UFO sightings into an easily readable table. At the moment, it does not filter based upon city, state,country, and shape. We have outlined ahead how we added these features to the filtering system.

# Results
The end user will easily be able to use the additional search filters. There is a “Filter Search” area above the table with 5 text boxes for each filtering criteria: date of sighting, city of sighting, state of sighting, country of sighting, and shape of sighting. They are labeled “Enter Date”, “Enter City”, “Enter State”, “Enter Country”, and “Enter Shape”, respectively. Once those filters are input, the table will output sightings with those search criteria.

# Summary
## Drawbacks
A drawback of this UFO Sightings filtering system is the case-sensitivity. The search engine differentiates between “WA” and “wa”. The search only registers lowercase entries so “wa” would be the search entry that would have any output.
## Recommendations for Further Development
For the sake of future study of the information presented by this table, we may want to standardize the outputs. For instance, looking at the “duration” column, the times are written in many different formats. Some abbreviate the word “minutes” with “min” or “mins” - some do not even write the unit of the duration of time. It may become difficult to scrape the information when there are many methods to convey the same type of information.
